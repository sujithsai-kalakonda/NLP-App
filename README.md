# NLP-App
This is a small window interfaced NLP App which performs 3 tasks namely NER, Sentiment analysis, Emotion analysis. 
1. This project is mainly focused on how to build a simple app using OOPs and a library called tkinter
2. Instead of DataBase I used dictionary in 'mydb.py' file which acts as Database.
3. You have to create an account in [https://komprehend.io/](https://komprehend.io/) website and add your API key in 'nlp_api.py' file.
